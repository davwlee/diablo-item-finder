A simple react app. This is for Diablo 4 by Blizzard Entertainment. 

This app simply allows the user to select a Unique item in Diablo 4 from a drop down box and then will show which monster types are better to farm as some monsters have a '5x' drop rate. 

Attached are also dungeons you can farm as well as the current seasons NMDs (Nightmare Dungeons).

This is a tool that allows one to make a gameplan on where to farm. 

This tool does not require any user input outside of the selection of item that is already on the website.

TO-DO LIST:
Rearrange in Alphabetical Order for readability
Add Season 1 uniques and their monster types/locations
Some more CSS work
Possibly add in "BEST" dungeons to farm based on feedback from community/reddit.
